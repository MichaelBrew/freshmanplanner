Freshman Fastrack Task List

System Implementation/Deliverable
- If we have extra time, make the schedule visible at all times somehow (still don't entirely agree that it will improve the site, but we're creating it for the "customer" that wants that so it's worth doing if we can)

Other
- Re-test on DC macs and pc’s 

Bugs:
- Doesn’t remember what we checked. Ie if I check chem. transfer, then check AP chem, then uncheck AP chem, the chem11 box will deselect. (Not sure if this was by design but I thought we had something in place that would keep chem11 checked in this case)

-IE still does not clear past selections making it impossible to continue if you refresh
