Freshman Fastrack Task List

TASKS
- (SAM) coen sequence only shifts when we would have 3 core in one quarter if we didn’t. also shift entire sequence so there are no gaps

BUGS
- (MICHAEL) When checkboxes are checked in Safari, they always perform an animation of about 0.5 seconds. That means when you check MATH 14, MATH 11-13 become selected then 0.5 seconds later become disabled. Not apparent in Firefox. Hopefully some way to eliminate animation, but not sure.

QUESTION
- Accordion style?
- For final product consider some sort of min or fixed width so resizing doesn’t mess up layout
