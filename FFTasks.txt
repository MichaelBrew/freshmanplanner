Freshman Fastrack Task List

TASKS
- (MICHAEL) Style “Done” and “Print” buttons
- (MICHAEL) Separate out radio buttons in AP and Calc readiness sections more
- (SAM) Prefer C&I sequence over 2 core separated (don’t think this occurs anymore)

BUGS
- (MICHAEL) When checkboxes are checked in Safari, they always perform an animation of about 0.5 seconds. That means when you check MATH 14, MATH 11-13 become selected then 0.5 seconds later become disabled. Not apparent in Firefox. Hopefully some way to eliminate animation, but not sure.

QUESTION
- Accordion style?
