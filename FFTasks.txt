Freshman Fastrack Task List

TASKS
- (MICHAEL) Remove major certainty question (UI and logic)
- (MICHAEL) Pick better fonts
- (MICHAEL) Keep sequences on same row (i.e. Math 11, Math 12, Math 13)
- (SAM) Prefer C&I sequence over 2 core separated

BUGS
- (MICHAEL) When checkboxes are checked in Safari, they always perform an animation of about 0.5 seconds. That means when you check MATH 14, MATH 11-13 become selected then 0.5 seconds later become disabled. Not apparent in Firefox. Hopefully some way to eliminate animation, but not sure.

QUESTION
- Accordion style?
